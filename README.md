# 100DaysOfWebDevJourney 🌐

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-86%2F100%20Days-blueviolet)  
A 100-day journey to master web development! This repository documents my weekly progress as I learn and build projects, covering a wide range of topics like HTTP servers, Express, MongoDB, React, TypeScript, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and more.

## 📖 About This Journey
I’m on a mission to learn web development by dedicating 100 days to studying and building projects. Each week, I focus on a new topic or project, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. I began this journey 60 days ago, and I’m excited to keep pushing forward!

- **Goal**: Complete 100 days of web dev learning and projects.
- **Current Progress**: 60/100 days.
- **Approach**: I create a new folder for each week to document my progress, though some weeks are missing as I spent time strengthening my foundational skills or revisiting older topics.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
Here’s a breakdown of my weekly progress so far:

| Week | Topic/Project | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Weeks 1-5** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript Fundamentals | Focused on building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (No folders created for these weeks.) |
| **[Week 06](week%2006)** | HTTP Servers & Express | Learned about HTTP servers and built a simple server using Express. |
| **[Week 07](week%2007)** | Backend of TODO App | Built the backend for a TODO app using MongoDB, Zod, bcrypt, and Express. |
| **[Week 08](week%2008)** | Backend of Course Selling Website | Created the backend for a course-selling website, focusing on API development. |
| **[Week 09](week%2009)** | React | Explored React and built a small project to understand components and state management. |
| **[Week 10](week%2010)** | Side Projects: Paytm App | Worked on a side project mimicking a Paytm-like app to practice my skills. |
| **Week 11-13** | Revisiting Old Topics | Spent time practicing and solidifying concepts from previous weeks. (No new folders created.) |
| **[Week 14](week%2014)** | TypeScript | Learned TypeScript and applied it to a small project. |
| **[Week 15](week%2015)** | Creating a Second Brain App with TypeScript | Built a second brain application using TypeScript to organize notes and ideas. |
| **[Week 17](week%2017)** | PostgreSQL & SQL Databases | Explored PostgreSQL and SQL databases, focusing on database design and queries. |
| **[Week 18](week%2018)** | Prisma & ORMs | Learned about Prisma and ORMs, integrating them with a database. |
| **[Week 19-20](week%2019,%2020)** | Next.js Blog App | Built a blog app using Next.js to understand server-side rendering and routing. |
| **[Week 21](week%2021)** | Monorepos & Turborepo | Explored monorepos and used Turborepo to manage multiple packages.         Includes a `chat-app` and `excalidraw` for additional practice and experimentation.

> **Note**: Some weeks are missing because I either revisited older topics to solidify my understanding or took time to practice without creating new projects.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Throughout this journey, I’ve worked with a variety of technologies and tools, including:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma
- **Languages & Tools**: TypeScript, Zod, bcrypt, Turborepo
- **Other**: Git, GitHub, Monorepos

## 📈 My Goals
- Complete the remaining 40 days of this 100-day challenge.
- Build more complex full-stack applications.
- Deepen my understanding of advanced topics like GraphQL, Docker, and deployment.
- Share my progress and learnings with the community.
